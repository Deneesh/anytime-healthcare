Doubts:



Product Name:
Anytime Healthcare

Readme:
This healthcare solution is kind of like an Uber/Lyft app that helps healthcare providers start their healthcare practice with minimum overhead costs. The healthcare providers can work remotely without having to pay a mortgage for a building. 

With this app, you can make a healthcare provider account and a patient account.


How a typical doctor’s appointment goes:
patient checks-in
patient waits
patient walks into the the individual room to be seen by healthcare providers
nurse or medical assistant performs tests and asks questions
heartbeat
temperature
blood pressure
Asks “What brings you in today?”, “What is your issue?”
Asks the preliminary questions, “Do you smoke?”, “Do you drink?”, “Do you testify that all your responses above are correct?” etc.
etc.
Doctor reviews the results and responses to the questions
Doctor comes into the room, does the appropriate tests, and gives feedback.
Doctor may write a prescription or suggests tests
Patient leaves and goes get the medicine or supplies that were prescribe


How Anywhere Healthcare is different:
patient selects an appointment time slot 
patient fills out the form regarding their problems and symptoms
MAD arrives with the proper equipment
The MAD and patient video chat with the doctor. 
Doctors gives feedback and prescription
MAD can deliver the prescription to the patient.




Healthcare Provider Account:
For certified healthcare provider (ex. doctor, nurse) who wants to start a private practice with minimum overhead cost
Schedule available time slots for patients


Medical Assistant Driver (MAD) Account:
For those looking to gain entry level experience in the healthcare field (ex. prehealth students)
This job is kind of like a hybrid of Uber/Lyft/DoorDash and being a medical assistant.
This role includes delivering the healthcare equipment for the patient to do the tests and to aid the patients in using the tools if the patient requests it.
Uber-like GPS tracking system helps the MAD find the patients
provide malpractice insurance
assume malpractice risk
provide training to the drivers and ensure the providers of any risks that occur during transportation


Patient Account:
Patient makes an account, creates a profile with their basic information.
Can request an appointment and choose a time slot in which they want their appointment to be conducted.
Fill out a form to tell what their symptoms are and the help they need
